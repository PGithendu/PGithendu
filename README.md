Work Experience: 
I work for the Global Fund to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis and Malaria since 2009.  My career began in Kenya in 2001 as a hospital pharmacist, followed by work in Namibia (2006- 2009) coordinating health programmes, to being a procurement manager for the Global Fund’s Principal Recipient. I then joined the Global Fund secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2009.  
At the Global Fund, I have provided leadership and managed large grant portfolios cumulatively in billions of United States Dollars (US$) for procurement and supply of health products to countries. This has also included large supply chain health systems strengthening projects in Nigeria, Medical Stores Tanzania, Pharmaceutical and Supply Agency of Ethiopia, Ghana, and Sudan’s Central Medical Stores. Other countries I have worked with are in Asia – e.g. China, Myanmar, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Philippines, Laos, Indonesia, and Central Europe— Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Latin America. 
I previously served as the first Senior Project Manager—supply chain, having started the Global Fund’s flagship Nigeria Supply Chain Integration Project while working in the High Impact Africa 1 department. This also involved working with many partners implementing health programs in Nigeria. 
In terms of health systems strengthening and risk management, I am well versed in the areas that contribute to risks in the supply chains that countries operate in that need strengthening.  My work has included development of country assessment approaches, tools and registers as well as implementing projects to identify and mitigate risks looking holistically at supply chains, in a pragmatic manner that balances delivery of programmes and compliance. 
I hold a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree (University of Nairobi), MBA in Healthcare Management (Regent Business School, South Africa), Certification as a Senior Professional in Supply Management-SPSM2® (USA), PRINCE2®- project management (UK), certification in Supply Chain Operations Reference Model- SCOR-P, Certified in Logistics Transportation and Distribution (CTLD), a certificate in Leadership and Change Management (MIT Sloan School of Management) and a diploma in Data Processing Management (IMIS- UK)
